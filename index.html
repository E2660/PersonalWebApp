            Hello, and welcome to my personal website! This is the place where I store all my projects and some personal information about me. <br>It's great to see that you're interested in my work, and hopefully you'll find yourself satisfied with what you see!
            In order to give you a good idea of what you might find on here, allow me to go in depth about the 2 pages I've linked up above!<br><br> The first page is an "About Me" which contains some
            personal photos, along with a brief summary and some fun facts!<br><br>
            The second page is a catalog for the many projects I have and will continue to create. Consider it as a makeshift art gallery, if you will.<br><br>
            Now that you know what to expect, I hope that you enjoy your stay!
