         <div class = "flex-item3">Born on February 6, 2006, I'm a Junior student at DACC (2022-2023). I'm in the Application Development & Programming program, where so far I've learned basic HTML and CSS, along with C# and soon, Unity.

            <br><br><br>I found my interest in programming through my father, who's very experienced in the field. After years of not only hearing about, but also watching him program, I grew a subtle interest towards the field myself.
